please note my programs will work even if the triangle inequality is not in place
it will always find THE BEST PATH EVEN IF THE TRIANGLE INEQUALITY IS NOT IN PLACE
This test will be a simple test to make sure all shipments on a triangular path can return an optimal path
that crosses every possible path (similair to euclidian path but bidireactional)

#triangle with 3 vertices will use a perfect triplet triangle 65, 72, 97

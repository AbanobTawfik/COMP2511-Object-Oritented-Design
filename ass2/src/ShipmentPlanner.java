/**
 * The ShipmentPlanner class which handles are input parsing and output printing, this class will take in a file input
 * and creates a graph based on input, connect the edges on the graph by supplying weighting, then finding a shipment plan
 * for a given schedule.
 */
/* HEURISTIC RUNTIME ANALYSIS
 * (as quoted from Wikipedia)
 * Consider integer n which represents the number of shipments where n>=0
 * And consider integer m which represents the number of nodes on graph where m >=0
 * (outdegree of all nodes are m since they are all connected)
 * The runtime complexity analysis for the A*Search without a heuristic in worst case is O(m^n).
 * in best case it will be O(n) where n is the number of shipments on the schedule.
 * However, through the use of my heuristic I will be eliminating paths that are “useless” and
 * prioritising paths which have great scores. The way my heuristic will do this is take the path,
 * and add the remaining schedule weight to the path, and the closest distance to the nearest node
 * on shipment to the last node in the path (0 if the last node in the path is a shipment itself).
 * What this will do is, paths which have longer distance to complete shipment, or paths which are
 * further away from shipments are discarded, their scores will be high and towards the end of the
 * open set. This will get rid of paths which have longer distances to reach goal state since they
 * will not be optimal paths. In order to calculate the effectiveness of the heuristic I will be using
 * the formula supplied on Wikipedia that
 * N + 1 = 1 + k + k^2 + …. + k^n to solve for K,
 * where N are the number of nodes expanded.
 * In one of my searches 19 nodes expanded, and n = 7 m = 5
 * 20 = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + k^4 + k^5 + k^6 + k^7
 * 19 = k + k^2 + k^3 + k^4 + k^5 + k^6 + k^7
 * Using an online calculator
 * K = 1.25215
 * The heuristic I have used brings runtime costs to O(1.25215^n) rather than the O(5^n).
 * this is because the heuristic will get rid of all extra branching which will result in less
 * suboptimal paths checked, since suboptimal paths will not be expanded on further during search.

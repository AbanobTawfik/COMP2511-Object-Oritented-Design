 * The interface Graph. This is a generic graph implemented using the stratergy pattern, where the method can vary
 * based on the task or type of input. the interface is designed for adjacency matrix graphs. the methods
 * supplid in this interface are all the core methods required to create a graph besides the add node function, since i chose
 * to run with adjacency matrix, i chose not to include an add node function instead, create it all in the class constructor
 * a list of vertices is created along with the graph in adjacency matrix form in order to give node identification to the
 * index on the matrix, eg. arraylist [sydney,shanghai,manila,singapore,vancouver] index 0 = sydney and edge[0][2] is the
 * edge weight from sydney to manila

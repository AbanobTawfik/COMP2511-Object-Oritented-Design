 * This class DirectedEdge, is a class which can create shipments as a pair of nodes which has
 * a node which is the start of shipment, the from node. and a node which is the end of the shipment the to node
 * this allows the direction of a shipment to be accounted for. it is a more advanced node pair for the graph.
 * A shipment that is for example Sydney -> vancouver
 * can be thought of as a directed edge <br/>
 * the shipment originates in sydney (the from node) <br/>
 * the shipment finishes at vancouver (the to node) <br/>
 * this class allows sydney-> vancouver to be represented as a node pair IN THE CORRECT ORDER (Sydney, vancouver)
